                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This idea started when I thought about how I would store this project when it was completed. I only have so much space in my apartment, so I came up with the idea of creating a wooden sculpture that could later be burned. It wasn't until I was actually milling this that I realized OSB wood releases toxic fumes when burned, but I was deep enough into things that I didnâ€™t care.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Once I was settled on the idea, I set out to find a design precedent. The only thing I could find was a decorative campfire centerpiece that I found on Amazon.</p>

If you don't want to use Carbide Create like I did and instead want to use Aspire, follow <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/lab/cnc/Shopbot_Aspire.pdf" target="_blank">these</a> steps. Otherwise, follow along:</p>

                                    <li class="fs-5 mb-4">In Carbide Create, add tabs to keep your design steady as it's cut through, adjust your cutting material and its thickness, and select the endmill you'll be using (1/8" double flute upcut)</li>
                                    <li class="fs-5 mb-4">Simulate your toolpath to make sure it looks right</li>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Overall, another... cool... week. It was unfortunate that the Harvard section couldn't mill for 4-5 weeks past when everyone else had finished, but I'm grateful we got the chance to at all!</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This wasn't an easy process to figure out the first time, but I can imagine with a few more iterations it'd seem much, much easier. There's so much potential for really cool creations with the ShopBot!</p>
