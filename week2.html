                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I had a lot of ideas for this mini-assignment, but decided to stick with creating a vinyl sticker for my laptop. After I decided on what I wanted to make ("I'm a huge runt" in Wingdings), I created my design in Illustrator where I played around with weighting, color, and font variations. I wanted to try to layer different colors in order to create a popping effect, so I copied and pasted the original layer on top of itself, then shifted it up and over by a few pixels.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In order to ensure that these layers would be easier to align when I was placing them on my laptop, I added a thin rectangle on each layer so I'd have a north star to align other layers to when I was placing the sticker on my laptop.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Once that was done, then I exported my Illustrator files as SVG, then opened them up in the Cricut design app. This application was fairly straightforward to begin with, but after doing my first print I realized that Cricut had reordered and consolidated the characters in my string automatically, likely as a way to save vinyl. I needed the letters to be aligned as I had them on my Illustrator file, so I grouped and fixed the placement of the letters to prevent this from happening again.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After I fixed that error, I went to reprint and saw that smaller characters in my design had wrinkled during the cutting process, due to their delicate nature. To combat this, I printed the same line a few times to ensure that if a letter wrinkled, I'd have extras.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Once the printing was completed and I had weeded the vinyl away, I placed transfer tape over the top of my design and peeled it away from the vinyl's paper backing. The hardest part came when I actually had to place my design on my laptop-- the transfer tape was stickier than the vinyl adhesive that was adhering to my laptop, so I slowly had to shear, tweeze, and guide the more delicate characters onto the laptop.</p>
