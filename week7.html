                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Creating a mold out of machinable wax involves rough and fine passes for efficiency, surface quality, tool longevity, precision, heat management, and chip control. The roughing pass removes material quickly, while the finishing pass ensures a smooth, precise surface, meeting tolerance requirements and extending tool life. This process maintains quality and efficiency while preventing overheating and facilitating chip evacuation.</p>

                                    <li class="fs-5 mb-4">Orient your model if necessary - I had to reset my origin to the bottom right corner. If I didn't catch this, my whole mold would've missed the wax stock.</li>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Now that we have our machined wax block, we can start casting our plastic mold that will cast our finished jello project. In order to end up with a food safe jello product in the end, I'd have to ensure that each and every step was food safe-- from milling the wax mold to casting my jello mold with food safe polymers. We had limited materials in time in the span of this one week project, so I'm just going to pretend that I'd ever eat this jello guy.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Every silicone, rubber, resin, or putty has different instructions for use. For this project, I used Smooth-Cast 300Q, which is a white plastic that cures within 5 minutes.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This project was... humbling, to say the least. It wasn't my first time working with molding and casting, but it was my first time working with a larger milling machine like the ShopBot. My finished product here looks super wonky, almost like a turtle.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">If I could go back and do this again, I'd be more adamant about using a 1/32" endmill for a my finishing pass-- I was told by teaching staff to use the same endmill for both the rough and finishing pass to save time given the limited resources we had available in the lab. This finer point would have given me more detailed features. Additionally, I would've requested a longer endmill for the ShopBot. Given we only had a short endmill available, it was unable to drill deep into my mold without the collet hitting my mold's walls.</p>
