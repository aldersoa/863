                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This week was all about learning how to mill your own PCB board. The schematic I created last week is a development board that enables me to more easily connect jumper wires, sensors, and other peripherals to the microcontroller.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As an interesting side note, the SRM-20 is a pretty powerful tool! It's the desktop milling machine we used for this week, but it can also be used to precision mill other materials like modeling wax, foam, acrylic, and much more.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The PNG that I ended up with last week had a few issues I needed to fix before I could start the printing process (bottom left image). After wanting to pull my hair out with Fusion 360, I resorted to Adobe Illustrator (like I always do) to get rid of the text, make all the pads totally filled in, and increase the route width to .1". Then, I exported the new schematic image (bottom middle image) w/ its respective outline (bottom right image) as PNG's from Illustrator.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">To ensure you don't hurt the bed on the milling machine, you'll need to secure a sacrificial layer under the PCB blank you intend on milling. I used an old PCB board for this. Then, secure the PCB blank you intend on milling on top of that with double-sided tape-- nothing fancy here. Now, your setup should look like the photo on the right.</p>

From here, I followed the TA's instructions that were posted <a href="https://github.com/leomcelroy/fab-notes/blob/main/MODS-SRM20.md" target="_blank">here</a>. Contrary to the way I typically document these weeks, I'm going to keep this in bullet point formatting for ease of parsing.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Now that you've selected the milling program you intend on using, you'll need to select the file you intend on using for the designs on top of your board. Traces are always milled first and include pads, routes, and other components you included in your schematic. These will be milled to a depth that engraves through the PCB conductive layer, but won't cut through the whole board like the outline will. In this board, I used a 1/64" endmill(pictured on left) for my traces and a 1/32" endmill (pictured on right) for my outline. If at any point in the milling process you see a blinking light on the back right of the top of the machine, it means it performed an emergency reset. You'll need to turn the machine off and back on to start all over again.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Before soldering, I was a little nervous my routes weren't thick enough to conduct electricity, so I used a multimeter to test various connections. Everything worked so I proceeded with soldering on some components.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I ended up with the following board, which I'm NOT pleased with. Our lab didn't have the right header pins and connectors so I ended up melting plastic onto one pad, rendering that connection useless. At another point, I pulled away too abruptly and accidentally pulled up the conductive metal layer on my board. The final result is... uninspiring, to say the least. That said, if I was going to improve this in the future I'd get the right components first, then practice adding AND removing solder. I couldn't find braided wire in the lab, so that may have helped me remove unwanted connections. Overall, this was a neat week-- I learned a lot and definitely feel empowered.</p>
