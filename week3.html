                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For this project, we were asked to write a program for a microcontroller development board that enables it to interact with local input and/or output. For bonus points, we could use different languages, explore new development environments, or attach external components.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Before starting any development, it's important to read the <a href="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO-RP2040/res/rp2040_datasheet.pdf" target="_blank">datasheet</a> for the components that you're working in order to understand the architecture and language you should use when attempting to communicate with the components various subparts in later programming steps. If the datasheet feels too complicated, I recommend going to <a href="https://www.circuitstate.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-rp2040-microcontroller-board-pinout-schematic-and-programming-tutorial/" target="_blank">this site</a> that breaks down the datasheet.</p>

                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As I went through this process of reading the datasheet, I had a number of questions bobbling around my head so I've decided to write them down in the hopes that they help you.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li class="fs-5 mb-4">Microcontroller vs. Microprocessor: despite my background as a computer scientist, I've had very little education when it comes to computer architecture, so I was still a little fuzzy on the difference between a microcontroller and microprocessor. Simply put, a microcontroller is basically an all inclusive system that could function as a computer on its own- it has memory, input, output, and so on. A microprocessor is a subpart of the microcontroller in many ways-- it has to use a system bus or some other means of interfacing with other parts of the chip like the serial interface, the timer, I/O ports, etc. (ADD SKETCH)</li>
                                    <li class="fs-5 mb-4">Pin naming: across data sheets and programs, you may have noticed a variation in the way pins are numbered and referred to. My Arduino sketch could say pin 3, but the data sheet could actually be referencing pin 26. So, why don't they line up? Well, we have different naming conventions to reference different perspectives we're viewing the pin from.
                                    <ul class="mt-4">
                                        <li class="fs-5 mb-4">PIN: viewing the pins as numbered on the board (ex. my board has '2' written on this GPIO pin)</li>
                                        <li class="fs-5 mb-4">BCM: viewing the pins as numbered by the chip on the microcontroller (ex. the Raspberry Pi datasheet says we should be referencing this part of the microprocessor using this pin)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li class="fs-5 mb-4">XIAO RP2040 vs. Raspberry Pi Pico: I saw these mentioned interchangeably across numerous tutorials online but ended up finding out that both of the boards actually contain an RP2040 chip and both are compatible with many of the same IDEs. That said, there are a number of the differences including price (the XIAO is more expensive), size (the XIAO is smaller), and pin number (the XIAO has fewer pins). (ADD SKETCH)</li>
